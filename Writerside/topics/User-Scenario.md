# Improved User Scenario

## Sign Up
If the user doesn't have an account, they must register by providing their email address and setting a secure password.

## Sign In
If the user has an account but is logged out, they must log in using their email and password.

## Dashboard
After logging in, the user is directed to a dashboard where they can see an overview of their account, including all locks they have permission to control.

## See All Locks
On the dashboard, the user can view a list of all locks they have permission to control, displayed with key details such as lock status and last activity.

## See a Lock in Detail
By clicking on one of the locks listed on the dashboard, the user will be taken to a detailed page for that specific lock. This page displays comprehensive information about the lock, including its current configuration, activity logs, and any recent changes.

## Modify a Lock
On the lock detail page, the user can modify the lock's configuration. This includes changing access permissions, setting schedules, and updating security settings.

## Modify Profile
The user can access their profile page from the dashboard. On this page, they can update their personal information, change their password, and manage notification settings.

## See Notifications
When an event occurs, such as a lock being accessed or a configuration change, the user will receive a notification. These notifications can be viewed on the notification page, which provides a chronological list of all events and alerts.

## Logout
The user can log out of their account from any page to ensure their information remains secure.
